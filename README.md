# Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualizer project! ðŸš€

## Overview

Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive tool that brings algorithms to life through captivating visualizations. This project uses C++ with the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) to create an immersive experience for exploring various algorithms.

## Features

- **DFS on Tree ðŸŒ²:** Visualize the depth-first search algorithm on a tree structure.
- **Dynamic Programming on Grid ðŸ“Š:** visualize dynamic programming table in minimum path sum problem .
- **DFS and BFS on Grid ðŸŒŒ:** Explore the mesmerizing dance of depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) on a grid.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the SFML community for providing a powerful multimedia library.
- Inspired by the desire to make algorithms more accessible and enjoyable to learn.
